## 🎯 WHAT IS A RUG PULL?

A **rug pull** is a crypto scam where:

1. **Token Creation:** Scammer creates a new token
2. **Liquidity Addition:** Adds liquidity to a DEX (e.g., Token/X1 pair)
3. **Marketing/Hype:** Promotes the token to attract buyers
4. **Liquidity Removal:** Removes all liquidity, leaving buyers with worthless tokens
5. **Exit:** Scammer disappears with the funds

### Detection Methods Used

Our bot detects rug pullers by analyzing:

- **Transaction History:** Looking for LP removal patterns
- **Deployer Behavior:** Checking if wallet has rugged previous tokens
- **Funding Chain Analysis:** Tracing wallet creation and funding sources
- **New Wallet Detection:** Identifying freshly created deployer wallets
- **Serial Deployer Patterns:** Finding deployers with multiple tokens

## 🔬 TECHNICAL DETECTION METHODS

### How The Bot Detects Rug Pullers

#### 1. LP Token Analysis
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for LP rug detection
async function checkLPRugPull(deployerAddress: string) {
  const lpTransactions = await getTransactionHistory(deployerAddress);
  
  // Check for LP removal patterns
  const lpRemovals = lpTransactions.filter(tx => 
    tx.type === 'removeLiquidity' && 
    tx.amount > 0.95 * totalLiquidity // 95%+ removal
  );
  
  if (lpRemovals.length > 0) {
    return {
      isRugPull: true,
      evidence: 'LP removal detected',
      riskLevel: 'CRITICAL'
    };
  }
}
```

#### 2. Deployer History Check
- Query all tokens deployed by address
- Analyze outcomes of previous tokens
- Identify serial rug pullers

#### 3. Wallet Age Analysis
- Check wallet creation date
- Flag wallets < 7 days old
- Higher risk for brand new wallets

#### 4. Funding Chain Analysis
- Trace initial funding source
- Identify connected wallet networks
- Detect professional scam operations
